\usage{
DI(traj1, traj2, tc = 0, local = FALSE, rand = 99, alpha = 1,
  sim = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{traj1}{an object of the class \code{ltraj} which contains the time-stamped
movement fixes of the first object. Note this object must be a \code{type II
traj} object. For more information on objects of this type see \code{help(ltraj)}.}

\item{traj2}{same as \code{traj1}.}

\item{tc}{time threshold for determining simultaneous fixes -- see function: \code{GetSimultaneous}.}

\item{local}{logical value indicating whether a dataframe (\code{local = TRUE}) containing the IAB
index for each simultaneous fix should be returned (with a local permutation test), or (if \code{local = FALSE} - the default)
the global index along with associated global permutation test.}

\item{rand}{number of permutations to use in the local permutation test.}

\item{alpha}{value for the \eqn{\alpha} parameter in the formula for di\eqn{_d} (default = 1).}

\item{sim}{logical defining whether or not the trajectories given are already simulataneous.
This allows users to provide already simultaneous trajectories to speed up processing. If sim = T, 
traj1 and traj2 may be provided as dataframes.}
}
\value{
If \code{local=FALSE} (the default) DI returns the numeric value of the DI index (along with DI\eqn{_{theta}}{_theta} and DI\eqn{_d}), and the associated p-value from a permutation test (see \code{IAB}).
If \code{local=TRUE} DI returns a dataframe that contains the localized \code{di} values (see Long and Nelson 2013). The columns for \code{di}, \code{di.theta}, and \code{di.d} represent dynamic interaction overall, in direction (azimuth), and in displacement, respectively for each segment. A localized p-value for a one sided test for positive interaction (and z-score) is computed based on \code{rand} permutations of the segments. The pkey columns can be used to match the simultaneous segments to the original trajectory (see \code{IAB}).
}
\description{
The function \code{DI} measures dynamic interaction between two moving objects. It
calculates the local level di statistic for movement displacement, direction,
and overall. DI can compute time- and/or distance-based weighting schemes
following Long and Nelson (2013).
}
\details{
This function can be used for calculating the dynamic interaction (DI) statistic
as described in Long and Nelson (2013). The DI statistic can be used to measure
the local level of dynamic interaction between two moving objects. Specifically,
it measures dynamic interaction in movement direction and displacement.
