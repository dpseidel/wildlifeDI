Version: 0.4.9000
Authors@R: person("Jed", "Long", email="jed.long@st-andrews.ac.uk", role=c("aut","cre"))
Description: Dynamic interaction refers to spatial-temporal associations
    in the movements of two (or more) animals. This package provides tools for
    calculating a suite of indices used for quantifying dynamic interaction with
    wildlife telemetry data. For more information on each of the methods employed
    see the references within. The package draws heavily on the classes and methods
    developed in the 'adehabitat' packages.
